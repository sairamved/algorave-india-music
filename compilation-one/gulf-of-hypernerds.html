                <p class="process-description">
                    This is a conceptual track where I wanted to up-turn academic ideas of computational music theory (7/4 time signature, Shepard tones) with electronic rhythms and cultural influences from hand drums (something I have been teaching myself for the past few years).
                    The melody drifts on Shepard tones, a popular aural illusion, like the illusion of cold detachment of technology where the real purpose and cultural resonance is not fully apparent.
                    In the background, a custom-trained real-time Variational Autoencoder (VAE) attempts to work as an overengineered delay line, constantly remixing elements on the fly. Pulling from a collection of drum & bass breaks, B-roll sound design, and snippets of processed vocalizations derived from rituals, applying a sort of style transfer in real-time to create a shifting soundscape.
                    It may act cerebral yet compulsive, leading you through a "gulf" where futuristic rhythm meets tribal sonic structures, pushing to make your body betray your hypernerd tendencies on a twisted dancefloor.
                    We are positioning this whole album as "algorithmic music" but also dance music, where a bridge between human emotion and machine creation is key. We wanted to challenge stereotypes about both futurism and technology being Eurocentric. We wanted to create a bridge between ancient traditions and modern tech, showing that innovation can come from diverse sources. Cultural roots as foundations for futuristic sounds, using technology not just as a tool but as an extension of creativity. It emphasizes reclaiming technology through non-Western lenses and the algorithms as a shared language with ancient traditions. The title itself came out of a joke from global events earlier in the year, but after some thought, connected with our idea of tech. "Gulf of Hypernerds" possibly reveals some kind of cognitive or emotional disconnect, maybe even alienation through technology.
