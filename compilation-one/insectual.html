                      Sai Ram Ved Vijapurapu (he/him) is an information designer crafting delightful experiences with data & technology who draws inspiration from natural phenomena, often using code as a means to that end. The turbulent material he chooses to work with, data, carries with it the weight of human experiences it silently witnesses; which then acts as the subject of transformation, revealing that which was previously unseen. In the past, his work has been recognised and celebrated by CultureHub, Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Bangalore International Center and Information is Beautiful, among others. Sai is currently at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program where he continues to evolve his practice by imbuing interactivity in his work.

                    Sai: When I first listened to the track [insectual], I felt compelled to close my eyes and feel the space. The sound immediately commanded me to try finding something, anything, in the darkness. In our first call discussing the piece, themes that came up were that of fear, anticipation, and an encounter with the unknown. What happens in a forest? There's no centrality, or perhaps there are multiple. All the visual ideas that then popped into my head were along the lines of tiny agents finding their way around a space. This is eventually what led to the visuals you see before you.
