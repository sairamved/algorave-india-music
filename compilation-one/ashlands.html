                      Pratyush aka the winterscapes, is a musician operating from Bangalore. In his previous life, he was academically interested in the question of artificial life, uncanny valley and how much human perception dictates the answer to questions within these domains. Now decoupled from academia, the idea of generativeness has sustained from that interest and he continues to explore machine generated music in his own compositions. While he believes that machines can and do make engaging music, his own biases rely on iterating music through algorithms and human interpretations, to build something that he finds poetic.

                       Mangesh is an artist whose practice spans music, photography, filmmaking, and creative tech, driven by a continuous spirit of learning and experimentation. As part of the code.drift collective, he focuses on improvising music and visuals through live coding, utilizing tools such as Strudel and p5.js to explore real-time algorithmic creation. In his visual practice, he employs a minimalist aesthetic, with his films delving into the human experience within spaces. In his music practice, he aims to evoke calm, relief, and healing, as well as their inverse, composing and improvising with synthesizers, VCV Rack, and acoustic instruments like flute, guitar, and keyboard, navigating towards new sonic and visual territories.

                    The name "the winterscapes" started from a purpose to capture sounds of a time, sounds of a place through imagination and deliberation. Lamenting what has been and what will come to be is somewhat self-inflicting but as this is largely becoming the direction of the pieces, I am finding the lament to be the debt paid for a better tomorrow. This particular piece, ashlands, occurs in world of permanent storms, a place struggling after an era of errors of our ways. In the pain, sorrow and confusion, there are tones of people looking for what is right and what is meaninig for them. I started this piece with all the elements I wanted to portray and layered them out. Almost all of the sounds are synthesised sounds in VCV Rack with a fairly simple sequencing but added chaos and glitch- which fit in with the world I imagine. I then worked on reigning in the sounds and in the mixing process, tried to highlight the flow of the track.
