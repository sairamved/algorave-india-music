                    Hyperbole samosa is an ode to two things I love that are absurdly different from each other: nature and memes. i always wanted this piece to have both these aspects come together in a track. it starts as a hyberbole with extended samples and streched hi-hats, segues into an interlude sample which i wanted to call "samosa" (just because), and ends with a chill electronic segment with breakbeat for posture.

The quirky samples in Hyperbole samosa made me ping Roguentropy for a collaboration. Fortunately right in our first conversation, I resonated with how he described the chill-electronic genre of this track, with a bit of dreamy,organic predisposition, and I knew I wanted to recreate this vibe in visuals. Two popping elements in the track were birds and samosas. So I experimented with patterns and movements, mixed with company-style bird paintings of India in the Colonial era. I also gravitated towards mythological representation of birds as a provocation juxtaposed with Roguentropy's take on AI, which is meant to be ephemeral and hilarious.
