              Algorave India Compilation One is a collaborative album and publishing project featuring 10 original tracks of algorithmic music, each paired with a generative zine. Curated by <a href="https://bento.me/beatnyk" class="link">beatnyk</a> and <a href="http://satyarth.me/trophallaxis/" class="link">Trophallaxis</a>, the compilation brings together sound artists from <a href="https://algorave.in/" class="link">Algorave India</a>, a community exploring live coding and algorithmic performance, and visual artists from the code.drift collective, known for their friendly approach to creative coding through playful urban exploration and generative sound & design practices rooted in their situated experiences.
            </p>

            <p class="process-description">
              Each track on this album is made using different algorithmic processes. Artists used tools aligned with their individual practices—from TidalCycles and Sonic Pi to Max/MSP and audio-to-audio synthesis models—to process sound with generative algorithms. These open-source environments allow for experimentation, improvisation, and unexpected sonic outcomes, turning lines of code into texture, rhythm, and movement.
            </p>

            <p class="process-description">
              For those unfamiliar, this might all sound a bit like Greek and Latin — but one of the goals of this project is to showcase exactly what’s possible when open-source tools and collective effort come together to create not just music, but an entire culture of making. This is accessible art made from scratch—by artists across India and the diaspora—pushing sound, code, and visual form into new territories.
            </p>


            <p class="process-description">
              Each zine in the series is a visual extension of its corresponding track—created with p5.js—translating audio into programmed visuals that glitch, pulse, drift, and loop. The zines are not illustrations; they are systems. Each one reveals something about the inner workings of the track, while also standing alone as a piece of code-based publishing. The zines are based on a creative coding based practice developed by the code.drift collective. They use the <a href="https://munusshih.github.io/p5.genzine/" class="link">p5.genzine</a> library by <a href="https://munusshih.com/" class="link">Munus Shih</a> and <a href="https://www.ileycao.com" class="link">Iley Cao</a>.  
            </p>

            <p class="process-description">
              Together, this project reflects the possibilities of open creative practice and aims to put a small but intentional marker on the global map of tech-art—from the perspective of artists working across India and the diaspora.

            <h3 class="process-title">What is Algorave?</h3>
            <p class="process-description">
              <a href="https://algorave.com/about/" class="link">Algorave</a> — short for algorithmic rave — is a performance format and underground movement that revolves around the practice of live-coding, that is, writing and editing code live in front of an audience to create music and visuals. Emerging out of the demo scene of the 1980s and 1990s— where people would swap demos of graphics and music software — live coding has been a medium for performing arts for almost three decades, but it was usually restricted to either the art world or tech and trans-media events. Then, in 2012, Sheffield-based musicians Alex McLean and Nick Collins decided to take live coding into the club environment, organizing live coding jams at local music venues under the Algorave banner.

            <h3 class="process-title">About Algorave India</h3>
            <p class="process-description">
              <a href="https://algorave.in/" class="link">Algorave India</a> is an art collective founded in 2018 that aims to promote programming as performance art through Algoraves, with the intent to establish more live coding practices and audiences in India. While Algorave India promotes coding as art through performances and concerts, it is also a strategy for community development, music eduction, computational literacy and functions as an alternative learning platform for creative coding and contemporary live-art practices in general.

            <p class="process-description">
              <a href="https://www.ajaibghar.com/codedrift" class="link">code.drift</a> is an immersive creative coding practice and community that turns city wandering into generative performance. Artists drift through urban spaces, gather field recordings, visuals, memories, and live-code them into atmospheric audio-visual sets using tools like Sonic Pi, P5.js, Hydra, and Strudel.
            </p>
            
            <p class="process-description"> 
              Rooted in dérive and urban soundscapes, code.drift invites playful, site-specific storytelling through code. It was cultivated by Ajaibghar, and has grown into a collective movement of coders, artists, and explorers building a new language of sound, space, and technology.

              <blockquote>
              "The idea for the album art came from thinking about how geographically distributed everyone involved in the project is. Having moved countries in my early 20s, I have often struggled with a lack of close friendships in my immediate physical surroundings; while being continually nurtured by connections - both deep and casual - across cities and oceans. In an attempt to feel closer to all the artists and friends here, I instigated a collection of images of "windows" - a window into their work, their inspirations, their surroundings, their everyday. The poster and other promotional material comes out of an iterative creative coding process that uses these images as the basis of various generative visual compositions."
